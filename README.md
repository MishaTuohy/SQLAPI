# SQLAPI

This is a basic api with CRUD functionality using a sql database.
It has a super simple form to collect data and query the database.

This just collects a persons data for no specific purpose.

There is a data dumb for the sql database.

index-db.js is the server/api

index.html is the front end as well as some code that makes requests to the api

personal_information.sql is a datadumb for the database used in this.

It is a tiny dataset just for the purpose of testing the application.
